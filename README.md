# Customer Data Analysis – README

## Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing customer data using **Python** in **JupyterLab**. The goal was to prepare the data for analysis, handle missing values, and derive insights related to customer demographics, purchase behavior, and preferences.

---

## Dataset Summary

The dataset contains **2,005 records** and includes the following columns:

| Column                | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `CustomerID`          | Unique identifier for each customer               |
| `Gender`              | Gender of the customer                            |
| `Age`                 | Age of the customer                               |
| `Items Purchased`     | List or description of items purchased            |
| `Category`            | Category of the purchased items                   |
| `Purchase Amount`     | Total amount spent                                |
| `Shipping Type`       | Type of shipping selected                         |
| `Profession`          | Customer's profession (missing values present)    |
| `Subscription Status` | Subscription status (Subscribed / Not Subscribed) |
| `Season`              | Season during purchase (missing values present)   |
| `Country`             | Customer's country                                |

## Environment

* **Platform**: JupyterLab
* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Libraries Used**:

  * `pandas` – for data manipulation
  * `numpy` – for numerical operations
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for data visualization
  * `missingno` (optional) – for visualizing missing data

---

## Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Loading Data**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("customer_data.csv")
   ```

2. **Initial Inspection**

   ```python
   df.info()
   df.describe(include='all')
   ```

3. **Handling Missing Values**

   * Checked missing values using:

     ```python
     df.isnull().sum()
     ```
   * `Profession` and `Season` columns had missing values:

     * For `Profession`, missing entries were filled using the most frequent value (mode) or "Unknown".
     * For `Season`, filled missing values with mode or dropped depending on the analysis need.

     ```python
     df['Profession'].fillna(df['Profession'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
     df['Season'].fillna(df['Season'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
     ```

4. **Data Type Consistency**

   * Ensured that numerical and categorical fields were in the correct data types.
   * Converted relevant columns using:

     ```python
     df['Category'] = df['Category'].astype('category')
     ```

5. **Duplicate Checks**

   ```python
   df.duplicated().sum()
   df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
   ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Demographic Distribution

* Distribution of gender, age groups, and profession.
* Country-wise customer count.

  ```python
  df['Gender'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
  ```

### 2. Purchase Behavior

* Relationship between age and purchase amount.
* Categories most frequently purchased.
* Average purchase amount by gender and profession.

### 3. Shipping and Subscription Patterns

* Popular shipping types.
* Subscription status across countries.

### 4. Seasonal Trends

* Analyzed how purchases vary across seasons.

### 5. Correlation Analysis

* Examined correlation between numerical features (e.g., Age vs. Purchase Amount).

---

## Key Insights

* Identify high-spending age groups and professions.
* Determine which shipping methods are preferred by which customer segment.
* Find trends based on seasonality.
* Analyze how subscription status affects purchase behavior.

---

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to cleaning and analyzing customer data using Python in JupyterLab. The insights generated can help inform business decisions in areas like marketing, logistics, and product offerings.

---

## Next Steps

* Apply clustering to identify customer segments.
* Build a recommendation system based on items purchased.
* Use machine learning to predict high-value customers.
